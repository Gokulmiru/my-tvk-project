        <p>TVK is the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam, a regional political party in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, India. It was founded on February 2, 2024, by actor-turned-politician Vijay, who serves as its president. The party's ideology is centered on Tamil and Dravidian nationalism. Addressing the partyâ€™s first public meeting at Vikravandi in Villupuram district, he said the TVK would follow social reformer Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj, Father of the Indian Constitution B.R. Ambedkar, and freedom fighters Rani Velu Nachiyar and Anjalai Ammal as its ideological mentors.
